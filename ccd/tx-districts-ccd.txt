NVAR = 30

NOBS = 18,786

(*) Fields have two explicit decimal places, unless otherwise noted.

(+) Fields represent sub-fields of the fields immediately preceding them.

Character fields “M” for a value was expected but was not reported, and “N” for not 
applicable. “AN” and “N” are alphanumeric and numeric data, respectively.

The file contains data for school year 2013–14, sorted by the NCES-assigned 
local education agency identification code (LEAID).  Data presented in this 
release are available in two formats—SAS datasets (.sas7bdat) and 
tab-separated values text files (.txt).

Note that starting with the 2002–03 CCD, all numeric fields contain a -1 to 
indicate missing and a -2 to indicate not applicable.  Previously, numeric 
fields contained an “M” to indicate missing and an “N” to indicate not 
applicable. Character fields continue to use “M” for missing and “N” for not 
applicable.  Starting with the 2009-10 2a provisional file, the numeric fields
contain a -9 to indicate that the data do not meet NCES data quality standards.

				code + three digits ANSI county code) based on 
				the location of the administrative office. ANSI 
				county number.

CSA		21	AN	Combined Statistical Area (CSA). The CSA 
				assignment is based on the CSA assignments of 
				schools associated with the agency, weighted by 
				the number of students in each school. A CSA may
			 	comprise two or more metropolitan statistical are
				as, a metropolitan statistical area and a 
				micropolitan statistical area, two or more 
				micropolitan statistical areas, or multiple 
				metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas. 
				If the school(s) used to weight the assignment are 
				not within a CSA, the field will be assigned an "N" 
				(not applicable).
				
				NOTE: Starting in 2006–07, this field contains 
				the CSA code for all areas. Prior to 2006–07, 
				this field contained the New England City and 
				Town Areas (NECTA) codes for agencies in the 
				New England States.

CBSA		22	AN	Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA). A value in 
				this field indicates that the agency's address

				metropolitan or micropolitan statistical area. 
				The integration of adjacent communities is 
				determined by the CBSAs of schools associated 
				with the agency, weighted by the number of 
				students in each school.  If the agency is not in
 				any type of metropolitan/micropolitan statistical
	 			area the field contains an "N" (not applicable). 

				NOTE: Starting in 2006–07, this field contains 
				the CBSA code for all areas. Prior to 2006–07,

 				in the New England States. This assignment was 
				made using a file of ANSI county codes matched to
				CBSA codes.
 
METMIC		23	AN	Indicates whether the CBSA is a metropolitan or 
				micropolitan area.

				0 = CBSA is equal to 70,300 or higher and does 
				not have an associated type code. CBSA equal to

				than one congressional district, the code 
				represents the primary one.

LATCOD		26	N	Latitude. Based on the location of the 
				administrative office. The digits to the left of 
				the decimal represent the number of degrees from

				indicates that no value was derived for this 
				school.

LONCOD		27	N	Longitude. Based on the location of the 
				administrative office. The minus sign (-) 
				indicates west of the prime meridian. It contains
 				an explicit decimal point. The digits to the left	
 				of the decimal point represent the number of 
				degrees from the prime meridian; the digits to 
				the right of the decimal point represent the 
				fraction of the next degree carried out to six 
				decimal places.  A zero indicates that no value

GSLO		29	AN	Agency low grade offered. If grade span data were
 				not reported, this field was calculated from the 
				low grade spans of the associated schools in the 
				CCD school universe file.

GSHI		30	AN	Agency high grade offered. If grade span data 
				were not reported, this field was calculated 
				from the high grade spans of the associated schools 
				in the CCD school universe file. When combined, GSLO 
				and GSHI are the grade span of the agency.
